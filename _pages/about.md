I’m a Petroleum Geologist/Consultant by profession with 8 years of experience. I’m now actively searching for an internship or job opportunity to further my career track in the petroleum industry and excel in Sustainable Energy and other fields of energy exploration and development. The next company I will work with will benefit from my solid professional and educational foundations, and my strong motivation to advance energy development in the future. Below are my notable accomplishments and activities thus far:

* Managed a total of USD $150M worth of projects, and identified 600 oil and gas prospects as a Petroleum Geologist in the Philippines
100% win rate for the technical bid nominations that I designed for areas of petroleum exploration, outranking other competitors and challengers.
* Single-handedly designed the technical evaluation studies for a UK-based oil company to make major decisions on their million-dollar worth projects, which required international-standard project management, presentation and technical skills.
* Seven (7) years of teaching experience as lecturer in Petroleum Geology for students nationwide taking the Geologist Professional Licensure Exam. This involved frequent travel to teach in remote areas in the Philippines.
* Guest speaker to numerous local and international conferences showcasing my prominent works accomplished in the field of energy
* Pro-bono consultancy work with Peoples’ Plastic Revolution, a non-profit movement dedicated to conversion of waste into useful products,  and establishment of a circular economy for a waste free future.
* Ten (10) years of active involvement and leadership in local and international geological communities including Secretariat role in SEAPEX, Vice President And Operations Chief of  AFAG, GSP, AFAG, and Vice President for Industry of the University of the Philippines Geological Alumni Association. This involved spearheading fundraising activities, professional workshops nationwide, and drafting recommendations to policy makers about global geological issues.
