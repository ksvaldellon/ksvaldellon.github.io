I am a final-year PhD candidate at [Nanyang Technological University Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg), working with [David Lallemant](https://earthobservatory.sg/people/david-lallemant) in the [Disaster Analytics for Society Lab (DASL)](https://disaster-analytics.com). 

My interests lie broadly at developing novel methods in the mathematics of disasters to better understand the potential impacts of natural hazards on cities. The working title of my thesis is “Dynamic urban risk modelling for long-term disaster risk reduction. My work involves probabilistic modelling of earthquake risk, policy-related modelling of future risk of cities, counterfactual risk analysis (i.e. imagining the ‘what-ifs’ in disaster risk), urban growth modelling, and calibrating volcanic hazard models using geostatistics. 

I previously received a BS in Civil Engineering and MSc in Civil-Geotechnical Engineering from University of the Philippines Diliman. Before pursuing my PhD, I spent 5 years as a senior modeller generating [nationwide landslide susceptibility data](https://resilience.up.edu.ph/about-us/) that’s freely accessible for communities in the Philippines during the aftermath of Super Typhoon Haiyan. I am now a recipient of a scholarship funding from the National Research Foundation of Singapore and Earth Observatory of Singapore.
