I’m a Petroleum Geologist/Consultant by profession with 8 years of experience. I’m now actively searching for an internship or job opportunity to further my career track in the petroleum industry and excel in Sustainable Energy and other fields of energy exploration and development. The next company I will work with will benefit from my solid professional and educational foundations, and my strong motivation to advance energy development in the future. Below are my notable accomplishments and activities thus far:

* Managed a total of USD $150M worth of projects, and identified 600 oil and gas prospects as a Petroleum Geologist in the Philippines
100% win rate for the technical bid nominations that I designed for areas of petroleum exploration, outranking other competitors and challengers.
* Single-handedly designed the technical evaluation studies for a UK-based oil company to make major decisions on their million-dollar worth projects, which required international-standard project management, presentation and technical skills.
* Seven (7) years of teaching experience as lecturer in Petroleum Geology for students nationwide taking the Geologist Professional Licensure Exam. This involved frequent travel to teach in remote areas in the Philippines.
* Guest speaker to numerous local and international conferences showcasing my prominent works accomplished in the field of energy
* Pro-bono consultancy work with Peoples’ Plastic Revolution, a non-profit movement dedicated to conversion of waste into useful products,  and establishment of a circular economy for a waste free future.
* Ten (10) years of active involvement and leadership in local and international geological communities including Secretariat role in SEAPEX, Vice President And Operations Chief of  AFAG, GSP, AFAG, and Vice President for Industry of the University of the Philippines Geological Alumni Association. This involved spearheading fundraising activities, professional workshops nationwide, and drafting recommendations to policy makers about global geological issues.


I am a final-year PhD candidate at [Nanyang Technological University Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg), working with [David Lallemant](https://earthobservatory.sg/people/david-lallemant) in the [Disaster Analytics for Society Lab (DASL)](https://disaster-analytics.com). 

My interests lie broadly at developing novel methods in the mathematics of disasters to better understand the potential impacts of natural hazards on cities. The working title of my thesis is “Dynamic urban risk modelling for long-term disaster risk reduction. My work involves probabilistic modelling of earthquake risk, policy-related modelling of future risk of cities, counterfactual risk analysis (i.e. imagining the ‘what-ifs’ in disaster risk), urban growth modelling, and calibrating volcanic hazard models using geostatistics. 

I previously received a BS in Civil Engineering and MSc in Civil-Geotechnical Engineering from University of the Philippines Diliman. Before pursuing my PhD, I spent 5 years as a senior modeller generating [nationwide landslide susceptibility data](https://resilience.up.edu.ph/about-us/) that’s freely accessible for communities in the Philippines during the aftermath of Super Typhoon Haiyan. I am now a recipient of a scholarship funding from the National Research Foundation of Singapore and Earth Observatory of Singapore.
